# Onboarding Resource Application | ORA

ORA is a mini-project built off last year’s project AURA designed to give the development team hands-on experience with Unity, MRTK3, and NASA’s tech stack. Throughout October, AR, Web, and AI developers will work through structured weekly tasks that ensure everyone gains a baseline understanding of the tools. ORA is intentionally small in scope but focused on collaboration, version control, and shared learning. The goal is not only to complete the project but also to build team readiness for larger-scale development later in the year.
